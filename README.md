# SWAB2

Updated instructions for SWAB (Solitude Without A Browser) - an unblocked Google Search exploit for school Chromebooks, with a read-only file explorer. Based on my Baghdad exploit (which is similar to @Brandon421-ops's Incognito On The Sign-In Screen exploit).

## Instructions

**(1** First, sign out of your Chromebook

**(2** Second, click on your wifi and click the gear icon to go to the wifi settings

**(3** Third, go to `Name servers` and set it to `Custom name servers`.

**(4** Fourth, set a minimum of one of the boxes to `52.207.185.90`. If it doesn't automatically save your modifications, disconnect and reconnect 1-3 times.

**(5** If it shows a `Network not available` page, click `Visit the network's sign-in page'

**(6** In the window click 'Webviewlink for tests'

**(7** You should see a google search window, the URL bar doesnt work but you can just google any website and it would work fine. Back buttons and refresh work
